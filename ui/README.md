# ui (Vue 3 + Vite)

Minimal frontend scaffold for the OC11 POC.

Run locally:

1. Install deps:

   npm install

2. Start dev server (proxies `/api` to hospital-service):

   npm run dev

3. Run tests:

   npm run test

Notes:
- This is a minimal POC scaffold. Next steps: add UI routing, improve forms, add proper error handling, and add E2E tests with Playwright/Cypress.
